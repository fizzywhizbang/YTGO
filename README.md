# YTGO

This is a Youtube Channel monitor written in GO with a GUI writtin in QT 

## Description

I originally wrote this in Python using QT5 and developed it around the functionality of https://github.com/woefe/ytcc. The purpose of this tool
is to monitor your favorite channels, keep track of downloaded videos, and search similar content on YouTube.
Although that program worked well I wanted to develop something similar with added functionality in GO using MySQL. While that version works well for me
since I have a server at home I decided to make it more portable and have it use SQLite and perform all functions on one machine as most of the world operates.
